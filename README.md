#  Ko No.1 - Arisu Custom Seamless Keyboard Case

 ## Documentations
 This Repository has the assets needed to manufacture a custom CNC keyboard case for the open source [Arisu PCB](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb).
 
## Specifications
- Seamless case. Simple design to limit the number of individual parts to get CNC milled.
- 6061-T6 Aluminum
- Bead blasted with finer #150 grit
- Anodized matte finish
- Color: RAL 7021 (Black Gray)
- Threaded holes for base plate and switch plate all M2.5x0.45
* **Dimensions**
- 359mm wide, 33.3 mm high on back, 22.6mm high on front
- This is Very similar to stock Arisu case
* **Weight ~6.5lb**
* **Typing angle 5 degrees**
* **Flat baseplate**
- Original design is for a flat base plate that is slightly recessed into the case. I have incorporated my logo into the design with a 0.5mm depth and fillet corners/top edge
- Copper C110
- Bead blasted with finer #150 grit
- 4 through bolts to mate plate to case with for M2.5x0.45 countersunk screws
* **Switch plate**
- 1.5mm
- Top mount
- 8 through bolts to mount the plate to the top of the case, M2.5x0.45 head cap screws

## FAQ
#### But why?
I really like the Arisu layout, But there is no easily accessible high quality case available for it that meets the Design I was looking for. I eventually stumbled upon [Jim Palmer's](https://github.com/overset) case design which fit the design Language I was looking for (with minor design choices i did not quite like). So i took it upon myself and modfied it to fit what i invisioned.
#### Will there be a GB?
As of right now I am planning on running a GB for this case
#### Can I use this case?
Of course! like Jim Palmer said its all in the "heart of opensource" feel free to use it in anyway you like. Although conisder giving credit to this and FateNozomi for the original Arisu keyboard

## Modifications Made
- Changed height of the case so that it sits flush on the bottom, covering the base plate
- Countersunk screw lengths are different sizes and deeper on both front and back
- Head cap screw holes are deeper on both front and back
- Repositioned and resized the USB port hole so that its smaller and centered with the connector
- Incorperated Bump-on spots on the base plate
- Changed fillet size on the edges of the case and base plate
- Added my logo on the base plate
- thicker base plate

## Credits
This case was inspired by FateNozomi's Arisu PCB, Arisu Case, and the [JP01 Case](https://github.com/overset/JP01) which was inspired by Lyn's EM7 and the fabled TGR Alice. This is referred to as the "open source Alice with arrows" and now with a solid Seamless case.
