Bead blasted with finer #150 grit
4 through bolts to mate plate to case with for M2.5x0.45 countersunk screws
1.5mm Switch plate
Top mount
8 through bolts to mount the plate to the top of the case, M2.5x0.45 head cap screws
Deck height
7mm (height from top of switch plate to top of the case)
Allows for use of 0.5mm silicone gasket that will make deck-height the ideal 7.5mm to submerge standard keycaps and create a nice aesthetic
Easy access to mounting screws to easily change out switch plates
Gaskets (Optional)
0.5mm Switch plate gasket between case top and switch plate top. This will recess the switch plate down to hit the ideal 7.5mm depth.
2mm or 3mm EVA Foam or 0.5mm silicone PCB gasket to place between the PCB and switch plate to help dampen sound
2mm EVA foam to fill the case cavity between the top of the base plate and bottom of the PCB
1.5mm silicone gasket to seal entire inside surface of bottom plate to reduce reverberation inside the case. This helps the base plate protrude to create a better aesthetic at the expensve of making the whole case 1.5mm taller
